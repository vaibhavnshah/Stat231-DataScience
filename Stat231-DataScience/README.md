# course-content

This repository will be updated frequently throughout the semester with labs, homeworks, and project materials. It will be useful to constantly have the most updated materials on your local computer (or server profile if using the r.amherst.edu server). You can do this by first cloning the repository, and then pulling in changes. You don't have permission to push any changes to this repo!

Follow these steps each time a new lab, homework, etc. is posted to this repo:

1. Open this course-content repository as a project in RStudio (see "GitHub Classroom Guide for Stat231")
2. Pull in changes: click on the Git toolbar dropdown menu or tab in RStudio and then click “Pull”.
3. Copy the file to your own repo
     - In RStudio, on the “Files” tab (in the lower right window; this is different than File on the top toolbar!), navigate to the “course-contents” repository, and click in the little box next to the file you want to copy (usually within the “homeworks” or “labs” folder)
     - Click on More > Copy to . . .
     - Find the appropriate folder in YOUR repo to save the file and click “Save”
4. Close the class's course-content repository project in RStudio
5. Open YOUR repository project in RStudio
     - In the “Git” tab in the upper right window, you should see the new file that you added to your repo. Click on the small box next to the file, and then click the “Commit” button. Add an appropriate commit message (e.g. “adding ps1A file”), and click “Commit”. Then, click “Push”.
     - Note that at this point, you could go to github.com and see that the new file is visible in YOUR repo under the appropriate folder.
     - Continue to commit changes (with informative commit messsages!) as you work on an assignment
     - Push frequently, particularly when working in shared GitHub repos for project collaborations (i.e. when more than one person is working on a project and code)
